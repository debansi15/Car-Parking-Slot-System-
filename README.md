# Car-Parking-Slot-System-

We have a car park with 15 available slots, and the goal is to determine how many of those slots are occupied at any given moment. Each parking slot is equipped with a sensor that detects whether a vehicle is present. The sensor outputs a logic level 1 when the slot is occupied and a logic level 0 when it is vacant. To simulate these sensors, we will use switches as input devices. The total number of occupied slots will be displayed using LEDs and a seven-segment display.
